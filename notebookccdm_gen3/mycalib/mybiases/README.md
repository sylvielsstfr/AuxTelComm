Gaol understand how to generate a MasterBias and see a Masterbias to be sure that I pick the right MasterFlat later.
Want to compare the Masterbias from imported/ingested calibs in 2022/06 (Bootcamp2022) / the calib I generate for 2022/03/17


## Shell script to generate a MasterBias and check a Master Bias

It defines the list of exposures to be used for MasterBias

- Generate the Masterbias : **GenerateMasterBias.sh**

- Verify the Masterbias : **ControlMasterBias.sh**  

## logs outputs

- in logs/



## Notebooks

- 0) View the list of available calib collections : **QueryForCalibCollections.ipynb**
- 1) nb to Select a series of bias to make Master Bias : **ListOfExposures-biases.ipynb**   
- 2) nb to view the individual bias exposures for the date 0210311  : **ViewExposures-biases.ipynb**
- 3) nb to view each individual bias exposures for the date 20220317 : **ViewExposures-biases-20220317.ipynb** 
The individual bias exposures look quite flat wrt column number

- 4) Ask to view a Masterbias showing strong effects with columns : **QueryForMasterBias.ipynb**
The strange thing is the very high dependence of the Masterbias wrt column number while in the indidual exposure the bias look flat wrt  column number.

Moreover the Observed Masterbias seems unchanged in 2022/03/17 (generated by me) compared the one in 2021 (from Chris W, ingested in my butler in july 2022).

The question is why I see the same Masterbias with previously ingested calibs wrt the new generated MasterBias on bias exposures of 20220317

- 5) Nb to conptrol the output of GenerateMasterBias as shown in BOOTCAMP 2022:  **cpp-bias-20220317.ipynb**
